                    <div class="about-six__text"><strong>One of the most searched questions on SEO:</strong> how to know whether your SEO company is doing the right work? Given SEO results take time to yield, it can be a little tricky to understand what your SEO company is doing for you. For some companies, even three months can be less time to rank higher. Does this mean you shouldn't ask them what they're doing? Absolutely not! In fact, our first approach with our clients is to give them a 360-degree view of where their website currently stands and what deliverables we can provide them in the next 2 to 3 months based on their requirements and goals. This also means we get down to the nitty-gritty of your business and might take over partial control of your CMS, Google Analytics, Webmaster Tool, and more. We do not gurantee you of top rankings within a month or two as SEO work relies on search engine alogorithms that can change overnight. We assure better quality baclinks, content, profiles and everything else that leads to higher ranking with right keywords and white hat techniques.</div><!-- /.about-six__text -->
